MUS file usage:
opening:
	this is a format made by myself, and you can't open it by double-clicking it.
	if you want to open a MUS file, you have to open "music.exe" and enter the file path.
coding:
	this is really a friendly and simple format.
	here's the way to convert the number in the file:
		-1 end of song
		0 stop for the time of a note
	other notes:1-do 2-re 3-mi 4-fa 5-so 6-la 7-si
	add 0.5 to make the note add half
	add ten to make the note in a higher octave
	for example:11-do in second octave
